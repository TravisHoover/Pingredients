## Installation
To install on an Android phone, create a file `local.properties` and <br>
and place it in your `/android` directory that includes: <br>
```sdk.dir = /Users/USERNAME/Library/Android/sdk``` where USERNAME <br>
is the name of the user on your development machine with Java installed.

You will then need to put your android phone into developer mode and <br>
enable USB Debugging mode. 

Run `react-native run-android`
